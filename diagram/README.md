> NOTE: All JSON examples in this documentation are formatted for your convenience and viewing pleasure.  It is not expected that messages exchanged on the wire will contain new lines, tabs & spaces so a human can read it. So the indentataion can't be programatically relied upon (like that dumb yaml), the formatting is just there to delight your brain. <br> The protocol does **not preclude** the messages to be beautified prettified on the wire if that's what you like.
