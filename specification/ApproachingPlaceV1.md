## Use Case:
This message is used when an event triggers it in a very special case under specific circumstances.  We hope this explanaion clarifies everything and is not too verbose in its layout of the sequence of events that leads to its usage.

## Example
This example would be for a future version that would support multiple scopes.
```json
{
  "Protocol":"Open-Autonomy",
  "Version": 1,
  "Timestamp": "2023-01-24T09:30:10.948Z",

  "V1":
  {
  }
}
```
