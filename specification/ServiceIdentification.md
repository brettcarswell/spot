# SpotServiceV1
The first message sent by the `spot` service.  It identifies that the client is talking to the right service and identified the highest protocol version it supports.

> NOTE: Security is supplied at the infrastructure level, not at the application level.  The Authentication and authorization has already been done by the time the client reahes this point;  so it is considered safe to provide a lot of information on the service beyond this point.

> NOTE: The API version will be incremented when significant new functions are added to the protocol or if backwards compatibility is broken.  Bug fixes have no impact on the protocol version.

|Sender| Triggered by | Triggers|
